This is a repository for a website that uses NodeJS for a topic messaging system. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the appearance and responsiveness, and Ajax with NodeJS for the messaging and emailing systems and as a web server.

This is an older version of the project than in the demo, since I didn't know how to use git at the time.
